Project Euler - Multi-Lingual
=============================

The purpose of this project is to develop solutions for [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) problems together
with a minimal "framework" and set of rules such that:

 * Solutions can be mirrored in multiple languages, allowing comparisons between languages.
 * New languages can be added easily.
 * Solutions can be run in various ways - different subsets of solutions or languages, with timing or benchmarking, etc.

I have only recently discovered Project Euler myself, and this project is not meant to be a "spoiler" for anyone else,
nor do I want others to spoil the fun for me of tackling problems I have not yet solved on my own. I do however, welcome
submissions for improving the solutions in either a specific language or all of them.

Even though comparing the performance of various languages is a key interest here, bare in mind these are not
necessarily very good comparison use cases, as these are hardly "real world scenarios". This project should be viewed
as no more than a fun academic exercise, that may or may not provide interesting insights about the languages and
solutions herein.
